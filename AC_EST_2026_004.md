## Project Costing

**Approx. ~ Rs. 8,00,000***

*\* Please check Project Assumptions*

### Costing Summary + Justifications

#### The system includes 40+ interconnected modules across 6 major tabs:
- **Masters:** 18+ static data modules (Item Master, Paper Group, HSN, etc.)
- **Admin:** Invoice lifecycle with and without Work Order logic
- **Reports:** 10+ analytics views (Machine utilization, Stock, Consumption)
- **Processes:** Complex operational flows like WO variations, production entry, delivery, and rejection
- **Profile & Access:** Department-role-based authentication & restrictions

Each module involves form design, validations, API endpoints, database schema, role-based access, and UI testing—totaling over 400+ hours of engineering work.

#### Modern Tech Stack (Future-Proof & Scalable)
- **Next.js** – modern SSR-ready frontend for speed & SEO
- **Node.js** – scalable, asynchronous backend with Express
- **MongoDB Atlas** – flexible, cloud-hosted NoSQL DB, perfect for dynamic master-data structures
- **Vercel** – zero-downtime deployment, edge-caching, CI/CD-ready platform

#### Complex & Custom Business Logic & Printing Integration
Involves complex flows like:
- Workorder regeneration
- Reel tracking and rejection logic
- Label generation
- Tax-calculated invoicing based on HSN, UOM, etc.

Deeply tailored to a printing press' daily operations.

## Project Assumptions

1. **Hosting & Deployment:** All third-party hosting costs (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, Vercel Pro/Business plan, SSL certificates, domain) will be borne by the client at actuals

2. **Third-Party Integrations:** Any third-party services (SMS gateway, email SMTP, cloud storage, printing SDKs, etc.) required now or in future will be procured and managed by the client

3. **Change Requests (CRs):** Scope changes, additional modules, or new features requested after finalizing the current scope will be treated as separate work orders and billed additionally

4. **Payment Terms:** Payments will be released milestone-wise, aligned with the development phases. A detailed milestone plan will be shared post-approval

5. **Role Matrix & Workflow Design:** Role hierarchies, access rights, and user workflows will be finalized and approved before development starts

6. **Print Format Design:** Templates for invoices, labels, slips, challans, etc. will be shared or signed off by the client before development

7. **Browser & Device Support:** The ERP will be optimized for modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). Mobile app support is not included unless specifically requested

8. **Data Entry & Migration:** Initial master data population or legacy data import will be done by the client. Guidance and templates will be provided by the team
